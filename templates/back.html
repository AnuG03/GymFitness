Whether you're lifting heavy or just aiming for a defined physique, a well-trained back enhances everything from daily movement to your overall workout performance. Building a powerful back not only improves your posture but also prevents injury and supports better lifting techniques.</p>

        <h3>Back Workouts:</h3>
        <p style="font-size:18px;text-align:left;">Deadlifts – The ultimate compound movement for total back strength, targeting the lower back, traps, and lats.<br>
Pull-Ups – One of the best bodyweight exercises for building width and strength, targeting the lats and upper back.<br>
Barbell Rows – Focuses on building thickness and strength in the upper and mid-back.<br>
Lat Pulldowns – Isolates the lats, helping to develop that wide V-shape appearance.<br>
T-Bar Rows – A great way to work the middle back, helping to add mass and strength.<br>
Single-Arm Dumbbell Rows – Targets the lats, rhomboids, and traps with a more focused contraction.<br>
Face Pulls – Helps strengthen the upper traps and rear delts, promoting shoulder health and a balanced back.</p>
